## Part - A
1. Write a program to sort a list of N elements using Selection Sort Technique.
---
2. Write a program to read ‘n’ numbers, find minimum and maximum value in an array using divide and conquer.
---
3. Sort a given set of n integer elements using Merge Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000, and record the time taken to sort.
